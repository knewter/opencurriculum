# OpenCurriculum
OpenCurriculum is a tool to build different curriculums.

A curriculum consists of a set of other curriculums.  The anticipated structure
would look something like this:

- Grade 1
  - Grammar
    - Verbs
      - content: link to wikipedia page on verbs, as well as links to various
        quizzes.
    - Nouns
  - Writing
  - ... etc

The idea is that any node in the tree can have either children or content, or
both.  The plan for the content at each node would be to link out to resources
on the web to complete that curriculum.

That comprises phase1 of the project.

## Phase2
Phase2 of the project would be to provide login capabilities, and to allow
people to flag a given curriculum as completed.  There will be no verification
of any sort.  This is just a system to help build curriculums, so that
self-motivated individuals can easily learn skills they desire, with the help of
online curriculum-creators.
